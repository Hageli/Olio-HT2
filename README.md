# Movie Review App - Android

### Reviews
This application utilizes Finnkino's API to gather data about the latest movie releases. All movie titles are automatically stored locally so the user does not accidentally miss any movies. The reviews can be added afterwards and they contain both a number rating out of 5 in addition to a text area for comments. </br>
### Schedule
This application also shows real-time movie theater schedules from every Finnkino theater across Finland. In addition to schedule, this app displays information about the movie's runtime, language, and auditorium, where the movie is shown in the spesific theatre. Sadly, ticket availability is not shared through the API, and the users need to check that in FInnkino's own system. This project was originally created as a part of my university coursework.

This applilcation is available in both English and Finnish. The language can be toggled within the application's settings.
